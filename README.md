<p align="justify">No problems known yet.</p>

## Development and Test Environment

<p align="justify">The Extension was devolped and tested on a machine with a Debian based Linux distribution istalled using the web UI AUTOMATIC111 with following specification:</p>

+ API: v1.10.0
+ Python: 3.10.14
+ torch: 2.1.2+cu121
+ xformers: 0.0.23.post1
+ gradio: 3.41.2

## Critical Points AUTOMATIC1111

<p align="justify"><i>AUTOMATIC1111</i> uses <i>Gradio</i> to programme the web user interface. <i>The Gradio</i> version used is extremely buggy and outdated. Currently my local installed version is 5.0.1, <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i> is using version 3.41.2. Following some forum posts the outdated <i>Gradio</i> version is given priority over an adaptation or update. This does not really motivates to programme extensions.</p>

<p align="justify">Even in the Python Virtual Environment, which <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i> is using, the subsequent installation of Python modules is not unproblematic. There is often a mismatch in versions and dependencies. It must be clarified on a case-by-case basis how problematic the corresponding warning or error messages are. So far I have been able to solve every problem that has arisen.</p>

<p align="justify">I am still looking for a good documentation on how to integrate custom <i>Extensions</i> into <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i>. So far I have to resort to analysing other extensions and also having a look at the code of <i>AUTOMATIC1111</i>. This is a very unsatisfactory approach.</p>
